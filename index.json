[{"categories":null,"content":"RRKive is an evolution of of the Arkisto website. This was created at the University of Technology Sydney with a small group of partners, and served to bring together a community of like-minded. The tools mentioned on the Arkisto site were mentioned in the Language Data Commons of Australia proposal and the principles and ideas are still relevant, but we decided to make a new site which which better articulates the principles and is more flexible as to how they may be implemented. While LDaCA has successfully implemented a range of tools that implement the named Arkisto standards, full adoption of the initial standards stack did not suit all partners and the principles were not fully articulated, so with RRKive we aim to clearly separate principles \u0026 requirements from choice of standards, and from implementation in code.

The initial version of the site (Q1 2024) is intended to be the start of a conversation with our partners and stakeholders, inviting them to critique and refine these principles with a view to collective adoption as part of manifesto, and/or standard architecture for Data Commons. Initially this is technical and word-heavy, but we aim to introduce some graphics to help explain the concepts – once we have brought on board more collaborators and refined these principles. What’s a Data Commons and where’s the data in one? Following the lead of Jenny Fewster, HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons Director at the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) we use this definition for Data Commons (@grossmanCaseDataCommons2016): A global trusted system of systems that provides frictionless access to high quality interoperable resources, services and artefacts for research. The abstract of this article says: Data commons collocate data, storage, and computing infrastructure with core services and commonly used tools and applications for managing, analyzing, and sharing data to create an interoperable resource for the research community. NOTE: This definition differs from others in that it does not use the word “open”, which is important, as not all research data can be made openly available; according to the [FAIR] and [CARE] principles can and should be made accessible to the right people / agents. For some background on FAIR and CARE see this LDaCA blog post. This web site looks at the core services and infrastructure needed to undertake the processes mentioned in the definition: managing, analyzing, and sharing; we do that below, paying particular attention to where the data resides in a Data Commons. This is about Research Data Commons deployments This site is about: A set of principles and an architectural vision for sustainable Data Commons deployments, particularly for data management. A toolkit for deploying granular sustainable archival repository software which can describe and make data accessible down to and inside of the files and datasets but using commodity IT systems to ensure data interoperability Enabling the ‘interoperability’ mentioned in the definition of a Data Commons above. One of the key inspirations for RRKive was the approach taken by PARADISEC (@barwickUnlockingArchives2018) where data is stored and managed using a very simple architecture with data and metadata at its heart sitting, on top of commodity IT services; initially this was a file-system and is now cloud-based object storage. The key idea was that the data should always be available to administrators independently of particular software services (though because some data is not open it is not possible to just put data up on an open webserver – mediation is needed). This site is based on a previous effort know as Arkisto, see the background page.

Research teams and IT professionals often focus on product – doing novel analyses using data flows and integration without putting in place the services needed for research integrity; assigning IDs and ensuring that those IDs resolve to data over the long term.
