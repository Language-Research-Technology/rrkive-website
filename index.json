It is designed with long-term preservation principles in mind; does not rely on specialised software and avoids the problem of locking data collections into monolithic repositories behind APIs. An OCFL Repository is a system of directories laid out on a filesystem using a prescribed layout. Each repository contains one or more OCFL Objects. An object contains an inventory and a set of versioned content directories. The metadata describing an OCFL object’s inventory and versions is stored as simple JSON files which are both human- and machine-readable, and can be processed with lightweight scripts. The structure inside the content directories is not specified, so any existing collection of files can be deposited into an OCFL repository and later re-exported with its structure preserved. OCFL places no restrictions on the file formats of object contents.

The initial version of the site (Q1 2024) is intended to be the start of a conversation with our partners and stakeholders, inviting them to critique and refine these principles with a view to collective adoption as part of manifesto, and/or standard architecture for Data Commons. Initially this is technical and word-heavy, but we aim to introduce some graphics to help explain the concepts – once we have brought on board more collaborators and refined these principles. What’s a Data Commons and where’s the data in one? Following the lead of Jenny Fewster, HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons Director at the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) we use this definition for Data Commons (@grossmanCaseDataCommons2016): A global trusted system of systems that provides frictionless access to high quality interoperable resources, services and artefacts for research. The abstract of this article says: Data commons collocate data, storage, and computing infrastructure with core services and commonly used tools and applications for managing, analyzing, and sharing data to create an interoperable resource for the research community. NOTE: This definition differs from others in that it does not use the word “open”, which is important, as not all research data can be made openly available; according to the [FAIR] and [CARE] principles can and should be made accessible to the right people / agents. For some background on FAIR and CARE see this LDaCA blog post. This web site looks at the core services and infrastructure needed to undertake the processes mentioned in the definition: managing, analyzing, and sharing; we do that below, paying particular attention to where the data resides in a Data Commons. This is about Research Data Commons deployments This site is about: A set of principles and an architectural vision for sustainable Data Commons deployments, particularly for data management. A toolkit for deploying granular sustainable archival repository software which can describe and make data accessible down to and inside of the files and datasets but using commodity IT systems to ensure data interoperability Enabling the ‘interoperability’ mentioned in the definition of a Data Commons above. One of the key inspirations for RRKive was the approach taken by PARADISEC (@barwickUnlockingArchives2018) where data is stored and managed using a very simple architecture with data and metadata at its heart sitting, on top of commodity IT services; initially this was a file-system and is now cloud-based object storage. The key idea was that the data should always be available to administrators independently of particular software services (though because some data is not open it is not possible to just put data up on an open webserver – mediation is needed). This site is based on a previous effort know as Arkisto, see the background page.
