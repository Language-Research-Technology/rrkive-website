[Oxford Common File Layout]: https://ocfl.io/ "This Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification describes an application-independent approach to the storage of digital information in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories."

[Protocol 1]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1 "Data is Portable: assets are not locked-in to a particular mode of storage, interface or service"



[Protocol 1.1]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.1 "Keep data in one or more general-purpose commodity IT storage systems"



[Protocol 1.1.1]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.1.1 "The storage system has a method to store and retrieve [File]-like datastreams using hierarchical file-paths.</dd>"


[Protocol 1.1.2]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.1.2 "The storage system has a method to list all the File-paths in the storage system.</dd>"


[Protocol 1.2]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.2 "Divide up data files into [Storage Objects] that form meaningful units, of smallest practical size."


[Protocol 1.2.2]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.2.2 "Each Storage Object is a directory (or storage object equivalent) containing the files including metadata and administrative files such as checksums that make up an Object."


[Protocol 1.2.3]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.2.3 "Storage Objects can be located by inspecting the contents of the storage hierarchy by listing the paths (1.1.2) for example by the presence of a file with a defined name in the hierarchy."


[Protocol 1.3]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.3 "Document and implement an ID resolution mapping system to map IDs to storage locations (FAIR-F1)."


[Protocol 1.4]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.4 "Store documentation about the conventions and standards such as (1.3) used in a data store within the root of the storage service itself."


[Protocol 1.5]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.5 "Data storage of well described data objects is considered separately from the current uses to which the data is put."


[Protocol 1.6]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.6 "Data files use open or standard formats where possible, independent of particular software (FAIR-I)."


[Protocol 1.7]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#1.7 "If data resides in systems, such as content management systems or database applications which do not inherently support all of the protocols 1 & 2  then put processes in place to export data to a system that does."


[Protocol 2]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#2 "Data is Annotated:  contents, structure, provenance and access and reuse permissions are comprehensively described with metadata and licenses"


[Protocol 2.1]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#2.1 "For each Storage Object, store metadata that describes (annotates) the object and (optionally) the files that make up the object. The metadata should be stored in a file or files with the data files."


[Protocol 2.2]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#2.2 "For 2.1 use interoperable general-purpose linked-data metadata stored in a file format which has an Open Specification. This may be extended with domain-specific or ad hoc metadata (which may be in non linked-data formats) (FAIR-F1,2) and may be stored in additional files."


[Protocol 2.3]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#2.3 "For each Storage Object, include at least one license document linked from the metadata using the appropriate  property for a  ‘license’  from the core vocabulary (eg http://schema.org/license), setting out in plain language how data may be used and/or redistributed and by whom (CARE (all) & FAIR-R1.1.)."


[Protocol 2.3.1]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#2.3.1 "It is critical that data that does not have an Open Access or public domain license is not exposed via a portal without access controls and that confidential licenses themselves are not disseminated. Licensing may change, be withdrawn and new licenses added over time."


[Protocol 2.3.2]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#2.3.2 "Documentation about licenses for deposit and archive-wide accession policies may also be stored with an object"


[Protocol 2.4]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#2.4 "Store checksum-metadata in a documented standard format alongside data files to help ensure data integrity."


[Protocol 2.5]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#2.5 "Represent Repository Collections such as archival series or other organising entities as Storage Objects; either self-contained with their member data within the Storage Object or as metadata-only Storage Objects referencing or referenced by other Storage Objects."


[Protocol 3]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#3 "Governance is in place for each [Archival Repository]"


[Protocol 3.1]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#3.1 "The purpose of the Archival Repository holding the data is articulated"


[Protocol 3.2]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#3.2 "Management systems are in place to sustain the Archival Repository"


[Protocol 3.3]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#3.3 "Deposit agreements are in place and documented setting out the rights needed for the Archival Repository as an organization to manage data"

[Protocol 3.4]: https://language-research-technology.github.io/pilars/#3.4 "Processes are in place for disposal/deaccessioning if appropriate to the purpose."
