title: Standards that can be used in an RRKive-compliant deployment

---

The RRKive principles can be supported by the following standards which help ensure interoperability between services and supporting the long-term preservation of data.

- Data Storage for an archival repository:

  - [OCFL](./ocfl/) The Oxford Commons File Layout
  
  - *Coming Soon - maybe* - the file-system implementation from PARADISEC


- Linked Metadata for describing data objects: [RO-Crate](./ro-crate/)
