RRKive is an evolution of of the [Arkisto website](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/). This was created at the University of Technology Sydney with a small group of partners, and served to bring together a community of like-minded. The tools mentioned on the Arkisto site were mentioned in the Language Data Commons of Australia proposal and the principles and ideas are still relevant, but we decided to make a new site which which better articulates the principles and is more flexible as to how they may be implemented.

While LDaCA has successfully implemented a range of tools that implement the named Arkisto standards, full adoption of the initial standards stack did not suit all partners and the principles were not fully articulated, so with RRKive we aim to clearly separate principles & requirements from choice of standards, and from implementation in code.
