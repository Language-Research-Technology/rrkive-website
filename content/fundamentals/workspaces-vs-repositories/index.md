::: notes
There is a fundamental distinction between repositories and workspaces

:::

# Examples of Workspaces

Generic workspace examples include:

- Survey tools (Survey Monkey, ReDCAP)
- Electronic Lab Notebooks
- Code environments (Jupyter notebooks, Binderhub, Github*, Matlab, R Studio)
- Research & Analytical Databases**
- "R: Drive" or similar storage
- Cloud storage such as Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive

*Yes, git uses "repositories" but these do _not_ function as archives -- don't assume Microsoft the owner of github will preserve research or other code

**No a database is not necessarily a _repository_ (more on that below)



# Features of a repository

*Get this right and the other things follow

::: notes
A repository is as much an _institution_ as it is a software  _implementation_.

# Differences between Repositories and Archives (and why we say _Archival Repository_)

Repository and Archive are closely related terms used by different communities -- they both have a core meaning about 'keeping' something for an appropiate time span. Some non-archivists might quip that archives are where things go never to be seen again while to non-archivists Repositories, or digital archives lack the rigour of proper archival practice.

In the RRKive project we aim to side aside these interesting discussions in the interest of finding common ground so we use the term _Archival Repository_.
